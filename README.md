# LlamaIndex-with-Llama2
A RAG application using Llama2 and LlamaIndex frame work
LlamaIndex is a simple, flexible data framework for connecting custom data sources to large language models. LlamaIndex plays an important role in efficient reterival of data in a RAG Application.
we'll build a real-world RAG application using LlAMA Index and an open-source LLM like Llama2. This implementation showcases LlAMAIndex's framework functionality, and the core architecture remains largely the same for paid LLMs like OpenAI's models. Let's dive in!
The data for ourRAG application would be a pdf from mckinsey's website : Insurance 2030 - The impact of AI on the future of insurance .
I'll be employing a Google Colab Pro environment with GPU acceleration to facilitate the application of the Llama2 model and LlamaIndex framework for data embedding, storage, and retrieval operations.
